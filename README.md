# Custom-Tkinter-ScrolledText
Custom Tkinter ScrolledText with textvariable and Text Changed Event

There are plenty of examples of ScrolledText but they do not have a text changed event.

This ScolledText will return the text when the text has been changed and sends back the proper changes when the Delete and Backspace keys are used to delete the text.
