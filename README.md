# Custom-Tkinter-ScrolledText
Custom Tkinter ScrolledText with textvariable and Text Changed Event

There plenty of examples of ScrolledText but they do not have a text changed event.

This ScolledText will return the when text has changed and sends back proper changes when the Delete and Backspace keys are used to delete the text.
